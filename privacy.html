    <h1>Visible (Game)<br>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> May 22, 2025</p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how information is managed in the Visible game for users under the age of 13.</p>

    <h2>No Collection of Personal Information</h2>
    <p>We do not collect, use, or disclose personal information from children under the age of 13. The app does not request or require any personally identifiable information to be used.</p>

    <h2>Contextual Advertising</h2>
    <p>Our app may show third-party contextual ads that are relevant to the content the child is currently engaging with. These ads are not based on the user's behavior or personal data.</p>
    <p>To ensure a safe experience, we follow these practices:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We do not allow behavioral or interest-based advertising.</li>
      <li>All ad creatives are reviewed by a human moderator to ensure that they are age-appropriate for children.</li>
      <li>We partner only with advertising networks that comply with COPPA and other applicable child privacy laws.</li>
      <li>Advertisements do not include links that lead outside the app without parental gates.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We may use third-party services (e.g., ad networks) that support our app. These services are only permitted to display contextual ads and are not allowed to collect personal data from children.</p>
    <p>Examples of third-party ad services we may use include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Google AdMob (configured for COPPA compliance)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These services are used solely to provide contextual advertisements. For more details on how these services handle data, please review their respective privacy policies.</p>

    <h2>Parental Rights</h2>
    <p>As a parent or legal guardian, you have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Review the personal information we may have collected (though we do not knowingly collect any).</li>
      <li>Request the deletion of such information.</li>
      <li>Refuse to allow further collection or use of your child's information.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you have any concerns or would like to exercise these rights, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:ilyasarafath@gmail.com">ilyasarafath@gmail.com</a></p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we will notify you by updating the effective date at the top of this policy. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>

    <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>The Game does not involve in-app purchases. All features and functionalities are accessible without the need for any financial transactions within the app.</p>
